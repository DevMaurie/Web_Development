            Hi I am DevMaurie. I am a Petroluem Engineer with a huge interest in web development.<br/>
            I've been on a self study journey for about two months now and has been really enjoying creating stuff.<br/>
            My languages are English, Filipino, Python, a little bit of Japanese and HTML/CSS/JS.

        <h3>PORTFOLIO</h3>
            <p> I first started exploring html when I was 13 when I got hooked on tumblr.
                I liked how I was able to customize my site, sort of like a personal blog with lots of weird backgrounds.
                I've always been curios about making one however life slapped me hard and threw me into engineering College **just kidding**.
